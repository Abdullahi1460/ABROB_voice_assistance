README: Speech-to-Text AI Assistant
This project is a Speech-to-Text AI Assistant that combines Google Generative AI, Speech Recognition, and Text-to-Speech technologies. The assistant captures spoken input, generates a response using a generative AI model, and reads the response aloud.

Features:
Captures voice input using a microphone and converts it to text.
Leverages Google Generative AI for intelligent responses.
Reads the AI-generated response aloud using pyttsx3.
Processes speech through Google Web Speech API for high accuracy.
Simple and interactive interface for natural language queries.
Setup:
Install the required libraries: google-generativeai, speechRecognition, and pyttsx3.
Configure your Google API key in the script for AI model access.
Note:
Ensure PyAudio is installed and your microphone is working correctly.
